#### What is an extra?

Remember that an extra is simply an element composed of an icon and a short text. 

#### Why are extras lists necessary?

In order to create an extra, this extra must be included in a list. On its own, it will not be displayed. It is most common to group several extras under a single title and for these to be displayed as a list. You can learn all of this in this guide.
