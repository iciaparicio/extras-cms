The contents of a list of extras are no more than the extras themselves. Use this second step to add them, manage them or delete them if they are no longer necessary.

Click **Add new extra** to add an extra to the list and fill in the required fields:

**List provider**. Indicates where the information to configure the extras in the list comes from:

* **Provider by user CMS**. Select this option to manually configure the extra.
* **Provider by Product ID**. Select this option to indicate a Product ID and receive the extra information via API.

{% hint style="info" %}
This information should be provided by your development team.
{% endhint %}

**Icon** 

Add the icon representing the extra. The default version (**Icon**) is mandatory and you have the option to add the **Dark icon**, which would be the icon shown to the user on the app when using *dark mode*.

{% hint style="success" %}
We recommend uploading both versions of the icon in SVG format. PNG format is also supported.
{% endhint %}

**Name of the extra module** . Name of the extra that appears under the icon. 

{% hint style="info" %}
:bulb: We recommend using a very short name. Otherwise, the name will be cut off.
{% endhint %}

**Action configuration of your extra** 

* **Not include clickable action**. Select this option, which is checked by default, if you don't want the icon + text of the extra to be clickable.
* **Include clickable action**. Check this option to make the icon + text of the extra clickable and to set the URL to which the user is directed by clicking on it. 
  * **Action navigation to**: 
    * **URL**. Select this option to manually include a URL. Indicates the URL to which the user is directed by clicking on the extra in the Web address field.
    * **Preconfigured**. Select this option to choose a specific point in the app. Indicates the specific point in the drop-down menu.

**Audiences**. Select the audience to which the user must belong in order to see the extra.

{% hint style="success" %}
ðŸ¤“Please note that you can have extras configured for different audiences within the same list of extras. Obviously, this is not a problem. However, it is important that you remember it because the user must belong to this audience when you run the test(s) that are required for an extra to be seen.
{% endhint %}

If you need to add more extras, click on the **Add new extra** button and repeat the steps described in this section.

Click **Continue** to proceed to the last step.
