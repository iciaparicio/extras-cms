Extras management
=================

As you have already seen, you configure the extras in the [Content](como-crear-una-lista/contenido.md) step. In addition to creating and configuring them, you can have options to manage them: delete extra, change the order in which they appear in the list, etc.

### Activate/Deactivate an extra

You can change the visibility of the extra. By default, when you create an extra, that extra is activated i.e. it is visible to the user who meets the necessary conditions to see it. In other words, it belongs to the audience for which the extra is configured.

If for some reason you prefer to hide this extra, use the control ![](.gitbook/assets/control.png)to disable it. 

Similarly, activate a deactivated extra to make it re\-appear.

Click on **Save** to save the changes. Please note that if the list is published, saving the changes means publishing them as well. However, the system will ask you to confirm your decision.

### Remove an extra

If you are absolutely sure that you do not want the extra to be shown and you want to remove it, click ![](.gitbook/assets/borrar_icono.png).

![](.gitbook/assets/borrar_extra.png)

\{% hint style="warning" %\}
Please note that **deleting an extra** from a list is an **irreversible action** . 

:nerd: If you are not sure, we recommend deactivating the extra instead of deleting it.
\{% endhint %\}

### Change the order

The order in which the extras are displayed can be controlled from the CMS. It is as simple as doing *drag&drop* to the desired position.

The top ones are shown first.
